In order to contribute to the Bot's code, you will need to:

***Note:*** If you are a TheGrandCoding dev, [the procedure is slightly different](https://github.com/CheAle14/bot-source-code/issues/1)

1. Contact Alex to recieve an invitation to the repo containing the source code.
   Only **three people** may have access at any point in time, priority given to those who actually commit
2. Fork the repository to your own profile.
3. Configure the bot: Read the README.md file.
4. Run the bot, to ensure it works.
5. Make the changes
    1. ***Note:*** Changes should have an issue open **in this repository** first, and the pull request should use `close #x`
6. Submit your changes as a pull request to the CheAle14/bot-source-code repository.
7. Done!
