## What is this?
This repository contains two things:
* *Some* source code for the FourAces#7039 bot.
* A todo list in the form of the Projects.

### Whats the source code?

Not all of it.  
Some of the source code has been included here, but some classes have been split into [partial classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods) so that some code remains for me, and some code is viewable.  


## The do to list?

* Any **Permission-related** changes (things that may add, remove or modify permission nodes) should be put at the [permissions project](https://github.com/CheAle14/casino-bot/projects/1)
* Any **Wiki related** changes (extensions or additional configuration) for the [wiki](https://masterlist.uk.ms/wiki) should be put [at the wiki project](https://github.com/CheAle14/casino-bot/projects/3)
* Any **code related** changes should be put in that project.
 
 
 # Actual source code
 The full source code of the bot may be found at [this link](https://github.com/cheale14/bot-source-code). It is a private, invite-only, repository.
